# SportsVision-YOLO

Welcome to the `SportsVision-YOLO` repository, where we have fine-tuned the YOLO v8 model for specific sports object detection tasks. Our models are tailored for two popular sports: Soccer and Ice Hockey.

## Models

### Soccer Detection Model
- **Objective**: The primary goal of the project is to detect Balls, Players, and Logos on the soccer pitch across various types of camera shots, ranging from wide-angle views to close-up shots. This comprehensive detection aims to accurately identify these key elements in diverse and dynamic soccer match environments.

- **Training Data Description**: The dataset comprises approximately 1300 frames from soccer matches across Eliteserien, Allsvenskan, and Toppserien. It includes various scenarios identified as edge cases in soccer clips. These scenarios range from the ball being airborne, not on the green field, to situations where the ball is closely adhered to the player's foot. Additionally, the dataset encompasses a diversity of colors present in these matches.

#### How the Script Works
- **Script Overview**: The script is designed to use YOLO v8 for object detection in sports videos. It can detect specific objects like pucks in hockey or balls, players, and logos in soccer.

- **Importing Libraries**: The script starts by importing necessary libraries like `cv2` for video processing and `ultralytics` for accessing the YOLO model.

- **Loading the YOLO Model**:
  - The model is loaded using `YOLO()` from the `ultralytics` package.
  - A pre-trained model specific to either hockey or soccer is loaded, with a default probability threshold set to 0.4.

- **Setting Up Class Names**: 
  - For the hockey model, it looks for 'puck'.
  - For soccer, it detects 'Player', 'Ball', and 'Logo'.

- **Video Processing**:
  - The script reads a video file specified in `video_path`.
  - It then enters a loop, processing the video frame by frame.

- **YOLO Inference**:
  - For each frame, YOLOv8 inference is run to detect the specified objects.
  - The results are then visualized on the frame using `plot()`.

- **Display and Exit**:
  - The annotated frames are displayed in real-time.
  - The script can be exited by pressing 'q'.
  - The video capture object is released and the display window is closed at the end.
    
- **API Endpoints**:
  - For each frame, YOLOv8 inference is run to detect the specified objects.Object Detection Endpoint: An API endpoint **(/detect_objects)** is set up to handle 
    POST requests. It accepts a JSON payload with **video_url** and content_type (either 'soccer' or 'ice hockey'). The endpoint processes the video to detect 
    objects like BALLS, players, or logosin soccer and pucks in ice hockey based on the specified content type and returns the detection results in JSON format.

This script is a basic implementation to demonstrate the application of our fine-tuned YOLOv8 models in real-world scenarios.
